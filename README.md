# Smart-Irrigation-System (IOT-Project)

## The Goal of this project is to reduce the Global warming by planting the plants and watering the plants regualarly.

1) The aim of the project is to help the farmers and the crops.

2) The Project also can be used at home as Plant Watering System.

3) This Project will display the values of Humidity, Climate Temperature, Soil Moisture Level and the Pump Status.

4) The ‘OLED DISPLAY’ Will display the details mentioned above.

5) The Values can also be seen in the cloud through website or an app, from anywhere from the world.

6) The only thing is that the entire project requires constant internet supply.

7) This is helpful for the Homemakers who are tired of watering the plants in their homes.

8) But for the farmers there is no internet supply, so they can use the OLED Display to view the Data of the Soil Condition, Humidity and the Temperature.

9) If the soil moisture is less, then the motor will automatically water the plants.

10) This project is focussed to water the plants when required.
